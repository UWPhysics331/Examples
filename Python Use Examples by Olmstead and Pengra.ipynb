    "- to put something in **bold** type, surround it with double asterisks `**bold**`\n",
    "- to put something in *italics*, surround it with single asterisks `*italic*`\n",

    "- to type an inline latex equation, put it in dollar signs `$inline equation$`\n",
    "- to have a centered equation on its own line, put it in double dollar signs, `$$centered equation$$`\n",

    "# Plotting Data<a id='plotting'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, plotting data is one of the best ways to get a handle on it.  We will use `matplotlib` for plotting, which we defined back in cell `[1]` as `plt`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can get a quick, autoscaled plot of ydata vs. xdata to check something with the simple command:\n",
    "- `plt.plot(xdata,ydata)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This, of course, is not appropriate for your final product.  That should have such features as labels on your axes, a title for your graph, error bars, grid lines, a legend, appropriate aspect ratio and axes limits for the data, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Plotting Functions<a id='basic_plotting_functions'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic commands are:\n",
    " - `plt.figure(figsize=(x,y))` makes the figure x units wide, y units high.  The default is 6 x 4.\n",
    " - `plt.grid()` adds grid lines to the plot\n",
    " - `plt.title('Title')` adds a title of what is in 'quotes'.  Note that the text in 'quotes' can include what ever you type (including symbols or Greek) by typing them directly from your computer keyboard.  It doesn't do Latex well. \n",
    " - `plt.ylabel('Y Label')` labels the Y axis\n",
    " - `plt.xlabel('X Label')` labels the X axis\n",
    " - `plt.xlim(left,right)` sets the range of the x axis (left and right are numbers)\n",
    " - `plt.ylim(bot,top)` sets the range of the y axis\n",
    " - `plt.plot(xarray,yarray,'sb',label='id')` plots yarray vs xarray with squares (s) that are blue (b) and calls it 'id' in the legend. \n",
    " -- The first character is shape: s for square, o for circle, - for line, . for dots, d for diamond, ^ for triangle.  \n",
    " -- The second character is color:  b for blue, r for red, g for green, k for black, p for purple\n",
    " -- The label is what goes in a legend should you have one.\n",
    " - `plt.plot(xyarray['xtitle'][n:m],array['ytitle'][n:m],'.')` plots the data in an array in the range n+1 to m from the column with title 'ytitle' vs the column with the title 'xtitle', as dots\n",
    " - `plt.errorbar(xarray2, yvalues,yerr=yerrors,fmt='or',label='id')` plots with yerrors used as error bars on the y data, with points having format in fmt\n",
    " - `plt.legend(title='optionaltitle')` adds a legend using the labels and data pt types (with 'optionaltitle' at the top if desired; if not, just use `plt.legend()`\n",
    " - `plt.xscale(\"log\")` makes the x-axis logarithmic (same works for y)\n",
    " - `plt.yscale(\"linear\")` makes the y-axis linear (the default if not included)\n",
    " - end the last command with a semicolon to note that you are done.\n",
    " \n",
    " If you want to plot just a range of data, and that range might change, it is simplest to define a range as an object that you change at the top of your code instead of having to change all the times it shows up.\n",
    " \n",
    "   - `index = list(range(N,M,P))`   produces the integers from N to M-1 in steps of P and stores it in index.  (default for P is 1)\n",
    " \n",
    "   - `plt.plot(xarray[index],yarray[index],'.')` plots dots for points N+1 to M of the array, taking only every $\\rm{P^{th}}$ point \n",
    " \n",
    " To do something else, check out https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html\n",
    " \n",
    "Below are a few examples."

    "  - `LinearModel()`\n",
    "     - $f(x;m,b)=mx+b$\n",

    "### Setting Parameter Starting Values and Limits<a id='setting_fit_parameters'></a>\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "It helps to set a starting value for your parameters and/or a range of values that you know will be appropriate (e.g., forcing a value to be positive).  Sometimes you also want to fix one parameter while you vary the others, either because you have measured it elsewhere, or because you want to explore the coupling between two parameters, or you want to focus on a subset of the data where that parameter doesn't have a big impact.  Sometimes, you want to do a fit multiple times, refining the which parameters are free to vary or the range of datapoints you are fitting as you go.  \n",

    "- `params_model1['par1'].set(value = val, min = lowlimit, max = highlimit, vary = True/False)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you have already done a fit that determined the parameters, you can start from those values when you run the fit again (or you can set a subset of the parameters to the most recent fit).\n",

    "### Running the fit<a id='running_the_fit'></a>\n",

    "- `fit_result = model1.fit(ydata, params_guess_model1, x=xdata)`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have uncertainties on the data points and want to include them as error bars in your fit, set the `weights` parameter.  Typically, the **weights** are the inverse of the uncertainties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `fit_result = model1.fit(ydata, params_guess_model1, x=xdata, weights=1/yerr)`\n",
